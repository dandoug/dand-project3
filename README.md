# Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 3

This project explores a dataset and produces analysis using a Jupyter notebook.

## Setup

Various setups are possible to reproduce, these notes assume minimal setup done prior.

1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), if necessary.
2. Switch to the project directory.
3. Use the [environment.yml](environment.yml) file in this directory to create an Anaconda environment called dand-project3
\
```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
```
\
4. Activate that environment with the following command (on Windows, omit `source`)
```bash
  source activate dand-project3
```
\
5. Start the notebook by issuing this command
```bash
  jupyter notebook investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb
```

This should open the notebook and allow you to start the analysis.  The terminal window where you start the notebook will remain running as you manipulate the notebook a browser.  To stop the notebook, hit `Control-C`.   To deactive the Anaconda environment after stoping the notebook, use this command (on Windows, omit `source`)
```
  source deactivate
```

Once the environment has be setup, you can restart the analysis by beginning at step 4. (`source activate dand-project3`), above.
